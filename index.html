    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my first website.</h2>
    <p> It is going to be fun learning how to create a website from scratch</p>
    <p> The project is about a freshly started company, called "Rainy Jackets". It is dedicated to creating high-quality apparel which gives comfort and warmth and at the same time enables our customers to experience the spirit of outdoor adventure and exploration. </p>
    <p>We at "Rainy Jackets" believe that the logo of the company "Pushing the comfort zone" well represents our idea to combine in our products durability with maximum comfort and security of customers during the activity of exploration out in the nature.</p>
    <p>Target audience is men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing.</p>
    <p>The jackets are mid-range in price and emphasize durability and being suitable for a range of different weather types ensuring customers are comfortable whatever adventure they go on.</p>
